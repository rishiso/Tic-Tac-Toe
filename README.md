# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a python-based Tic Tac Toe game against a computer AI.

The board is a 2 dimensional array. X's are represented with 1, O's are represented with 2, and blank spaces are represented by 0.

In order to place a move on the board, you must input a key from 0-8. Each number corresponds to a certain space.
